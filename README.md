# Rename_PixivUtil2
i made this cuz i am lazy to rename everything and this makes it easier to order by newest without changing the order of the images on the same post
# How to use
place the executable on the folder you wish the files to be renamed and execute it
this program will make another folder and copy the files to that folder, renaming it in the process

btw this will throw an exception if there is a file with a name that already exists on the folder and im too lazy to fix it

like i said, i made this cuz im lazy, the quality is crap probably,
but at least is easy and if i just made that it would rename it directly, it would be a pain to undo what the program did,
that's why i made it so it copied instead
